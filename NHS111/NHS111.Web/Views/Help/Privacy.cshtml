    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
        When you use the 111 service information about your condition is collected so we can understand it. In addition we collect anonymous information about how you reached the website. This is so we can improve the service for future users. However unless you choose to be referred no information that can identify you is collected.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you do choose to participate in the triage and be referred this is what we collect:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Age and sex – so the service can provide you with the most accurate medical triage</li>
        <li>Location information – we need your postcode so we can find the most appropriate medical service for your condition. To help keep your privacy we only keep the first part of your postcode on the system.</li>
        <li>Personal information – we will ask for this only where you would like to be referred to a health care provider. For this we will collect your first name, last name, email address, postcode, address and telephone number or we ask for the details of the person you are contacting us about. This information along with the advice you’ve been given will be passed to a healthcare professional.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Without this information we cannot provide the service you have requested.
    </p>

    <p>
        The information is collected by NHS Digital who provide the technical side of the 111 service. We store copies of clinical records for audit purposes only with strict security controls. After 8 years (which is the standard retention period for this type of record) it will be securely deleted from NHS Digital’s systems. By agreeing to be referred to a healthcare professional you agree to this.
    </p>

    <p>
        The healthcare team that your information is passed to will have their own policies which cover the use of the information you have provided. This will include who they may share your information with to provide further healthcare.
    </p>

    <p>
